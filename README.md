### Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹


I am a developer based in Korea, my work is focusing on creating UI for dashboards and systems and making it easier for users to use them.
I hope my codes and npm packages I made will good for you.


### What I'm up to

Currently I'm focusing on the company's project I'm working for.
And i'm preparing to tidy up [vue-slim-stackedbar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-slim-stackedbar).
This package has changed a lot compared to its original content as it was used for the company's project I'm working for.
